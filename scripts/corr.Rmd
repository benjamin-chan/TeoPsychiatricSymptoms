Subject: [EXTERNAL] Correlation Matrix of your Paper - Request from a Researcher at UPenn  

Dear Dr. Alan Teo

My name is Yiqin Zhu and I am a research assistant under Dr. Lily Brown at the
University of Pennsylvania. Dr. Brown is working on a review paper and
meta-analysis. In the process, she came across your article entitled "Frequency
of social contact in-person vs. on Facebook: An examination of associations with
psychiatric symptoms in military veterans". She would be very interested in
including the paper in the analysis, but would need a correlation matrix from
the variables that you included in order to do so. I am writing on her behalf to
inquire about whether you might be willing to share the correlation matrix that
corresponds to the dataset from this article.

If you have any questions or concerns about this, you are welcome to contact Dr.
Lily Brown â€“ her email address is lilybr@pennmedicine.upenn.edu and her office
phone number is 215-746-3346. She is happy to answer any questions that you
have, or to arrange for a time to speak if that would be helpful.

Thank you very much for considering.

Sincerely,

Dear Dr. Teo,

Thank you so much! For this paper, we are interested in the correlations between
the following:

PC-PTSD
In-person social interaction
Social media social contact
DSI-SS

Please let me know if you need additional information. Thank you!

* `ptsd` PC-PTSD
  * Name of scale: PC-PTSD 
  * 6-point scale
  * Positive screen: `ptsd_intrusive` + `ptsd_avoidant` + `ptsd_guarded` + `ptsd_numb` + `ptsd_guilty` $\ge$ 3
* `comm_inperson` In-person social interaction
  * 5-point scale
* `fmss` Social media social contact
  * Modified Facebook Measure of Social Support (FMSS)
  * Continuous scale
  * Reverse-scored items are `fmss_r7` through `fmss_r10`
* `dsiss` DSI-SS
  * See [Joiner 2002](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005796701000171)
  * *Scores on each item range from 0 to 3 and, for the inventory, from 0 to 12, with higher scores reflecting greater severity of suicidal ideation.*
